## About me 🙋‍♀️
My name is Edyta Fuchs. Recently, I've started broadening my IT knowledge in order to become a Software Tester. 
I discovered that a career path as a Software Tester is something that could suit me the most. 
I pay attention to detail and can successfully manage multiple tasks under limited-time.
When I started digging into testing topic, firstly I completed basic software tesing course and I only made sure that this is something that I'm interested in. 
I am still striving to expand my knowledge in the field of software testing. I pay attention to details, I like to gain new knowledge and I am meticulous.
